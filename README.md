# Google Sheets Example

## Getting Started

The Google Sheets project developed with Flutter is a versatile application that allows users to input data from within the app, which is then seamlessly stored in an Excel sheet. This integration between Flutter and Google Sheets provides a convenient way to manage and analyze data, combining the user-friendly interface of a mobile app with the powerful data processing capabilities of spreadsheets.
